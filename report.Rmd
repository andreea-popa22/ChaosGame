### **The application** {.tabset}


#### **Introduction** 

\


For the course of Probabilities and Statistics we had to make a web application using **Rmarkdown** and **Shiny**. 
You can see below our vision about it and our code, as well as the shiny app. 

\ 

>Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from **R**. \
*- see more on [shiny.rstudio.com][1]*

>R Markdown is a file format for making dynamic documents with R. An R Markdown document is written in markdown.\
*- see more on [rmarkdown.rstudio.com][1]*

\

***

\
**Theme**

>In mathematics, a fractal is a self-similar subset of Euclidean space whose fractal dimension strictly exceeds its topological dimension. Fractals appear the same at different levels.


>As *Wikipedia* says, **The Chaos Game** is a method of creating a fractal, using a polygon and an initial point selected at random inside it. The fractal is created by iteratively creating a sequence of points. 


\

You can see a video about it on [Youtube][3]:

\
\
\

***

\
In general, the fractal is created by iteratively following some rules:

* *Step 1:* start with an initial random point
* *Step 2:* chose a vertex at random 
* *Step 3:* chose a fraction of the distance (the coefficient) between the previous point
and the chosen vertex.
* Repeat Step 2 and 3. 

\


We implemented The Chaos Game for 4 polygons:  

* **Triangle**: 
    Using a regular triangle and the factor *or the coefficient*  $\frac{1}{2}$ will result in the known **[Sierpinski triangle][4]**.

    ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Sierpinski_Chaos.gif)
    
    \
    \
    \
    
* **Pentagon**: 
    \
    \
    We used the same factor: $\frac{1}{2}$.
    \
    \

* **Square**: 
     If the chaos game is run with a square, and the coefficient is $\frac{1}{2}$, the square will evenly fill with points.
     \
     \
     ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/V4_unrestrict.gif)
      \
     \
     However, to make the fractal possible, we should add one more rule: *the chosen vertex should not be the same as the previous one*.
     \
     \
     ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/V4_ban1.gif)
     \
     \
     
* **Hexagon**:
    For the **Sierpinksi Hexagon** or hexaflake, the coefficient is $\frac{2}{3}$.

#### **Implementation**

\
\

We created a basic shiny app that has 3 parts:

+ the User Interface
+ the Server part
+ the ShinyApp that combines both the UI and the server.

\

***

\


**For the UI**:

+ we made a function to print a breakline multiple times.
```
linebreaks <- function(n){HTML(strrep(br(), n))}

```
+ used *sidebarLayout()* function to create a layout that contained input in the *sidebarPanel()* for variables such as: the color of the fractal, the number of points and the coefficient. The user can also select the shape of the fractal from the 4 ones.

```
 sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(
            # slider input for the number of drawn points
            sliderInput(inputId = "points",
                        label = "Number of points:",
                        min = 1,
                        max = 10000,
                        value = 1000,
                        sep = ".",
                        #dragRange = TRUE,
                        #interval = 0.0001,
                        #loop = TRUE,
                        #animate = TRUE
            ),
            
            # slider input for the color of the points
            selectInput(inputId = "color",
                        label = "Color of points:",
                        c("Black" = "black",
                          "Grey" = "gray61",
                          "Red" = "indianred3", 
                          "Blue" = "royalblue3",
                          "Purple" = "plum",
                          "Multicolored" = "multi")
            ),
            
            # slider input for the shape of the polygon
            selectInput(inputId = "shape",
                        label = "Shape of polygon:",
                        c("Triangle" = "tri",
                          "Square" = "sq",
                          "Pentagon" = "penta",
                          "Hexagon" = "hex")
            ),
            
            # slider input for the coefficient of the distance between the current point and the next one
            selectInput(inputId = "coef",
                        label = "Distance coefficient:",
                        c("1/2" = "1/2",
                          "2/3" = "2/3")
            )
        ),
```


+ The **main panel** contains the disired fractal and that was made using the *plotOutput()* function.

```
 mainPanel(
            plotOutput("distPlot")
        )
```

\

***

\

**For the server**:

+ we used *renderPlot()* function to render the reactive plot that was assigned to an output slot.

+ for each polygon, we set the coordinates from the initial figure, 
taking into account some mathematical conventions. 

```
a <- c(0, 400, 800) 
b <- c(0, 800, 0)
```
+ with the *par()* function we set the margins of the plot.

```
par(mar = rep(0, 4))
```

+ we created the plot with the first 3, 4, 5 or 6 points (vertices) using the basic *plot()* function.

```
plot(a, b, col= "red", pch = 15, cex = 1, axes = FALSE)
```
+ we chose the random point that is represented by two coordinates **x and y**.

```
x <- sample(0:800, 1)
y <- sample(0:800, 1)
```

+ for chosing a vertex, we used the *sample()* function.

```
vertex <- sample(1:3, 1)
```

+ we repeted the process explained above, as many times as the number of points the user selected.


+ after finding out the coordinates of the new point, we use the *points()* function to plot the new point.

```
points(x, y, pch = 16, col = input$color, cex = 0.5)
```
